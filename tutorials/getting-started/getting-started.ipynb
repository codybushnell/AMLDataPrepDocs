In this \"Getting Started\" guide, we'll showcase a few highlights that make this SDK shine for big datasets where `pandas` and `dplyr` can fall short. Using the [Ford GoBike dataset](https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data) as an example, we'll cover how to build Dataflows that allow you to:\n",

In fact, these smart transformations can also handle more complex derivations like inferring the day of the week from datetimes."

In our case, we'll create assertions to handle potentially erroneous `member_birth_year` values. The oldest person on record is no more than 130 years old, so birth year listed as before 1900 is wrong. Though our `sampled_gobike` dataset doesn't have any issues, we would fail on the full `gobike` dataset if we made that assumption. However, Azure ML Data Prep allows us to handle these gracefully with assertions."

To do so, you can export the `.dprep` file you've written tested on a smaller dataset, then run it with your larger dataset. Here, we show how you can export your new package. For a more detailed example on how to execute it on Spark, check out our [New York Taxicab scenario](https://github.com/Microsoft/PendletonDocs/blob/master/Scenarios/NYTaxiCab/01.new_york_taxi.ipynb)."
